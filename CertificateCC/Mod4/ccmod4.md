# Frequent Challenges

In this assignment I would like to thoughtfully address some of the institutional challenges I have wrestled with as both the OER librarian and the chief copyright resource for faculty, staff and administration.

## Audience

This challenge is not about any particular issue, but about how to speak to the different type of audiences on your campus.

This short video by COMMpadres Media includes topics such as the importance and types of audience analysis, and methods for gathering information for audience analysis. [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/)

## Misconceptions & the Need to KNOW

This challenge is a frequent and repeated issue.  Faculty will want to know how much they can use and if their use is "OK".  

There is a lot of scary language around copyright including some harsh penalties that are played before disk and streaming media every time you choose to watch something.

___

## Scholarly Communication & Faculty Contracts
### (P.S. Work for Hire)

This is where the rubber is going to hit the road at your institution.  Its going to be very important to read and assess the contract that governs faculty work where you are.

There is also the federal 'Work for Hire' [17 U.S.C. ยง 101](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ30.pdf) that governs works created during employment.
