Did you know that librarians are available to be part of online discussions, to create online modules for Canvas in Information Literacy catagories and to provide instructions for linking to a variety of resources?

The WCC Library is eager to assist you and your students with research and library instruction. We endeavor to build collections to support your courses and individual research needs. We value your input. Please let us know of any particular books, dvds, etc. that you think would be useful to you or your students, and we will make certain that they are part of our collection.

You can schedule [library instruction online](http://library.whatcom.edu/faculty/research-instruction) and you will receive an email confirmation. 

We have started using [Research Guides](http://library.whatcom.edu/find/research-guides) to supplement library instructions and for faculty members who may not have class time for a library instruction. A Research Guide is simply an online resources linked from Canvas or your Syllabus that guides students on using the library’s resources and showcases resources for specific discipline. 

To start working on a class specific guide, or to contact me for any other library service, [please email me](mailto:rmckernan@whatcom.edu).
