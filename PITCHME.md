Festival Theme
## Higher Education: Handle with Care
How does care manifest or fail to manifest in our practices, policies, structures, spaces, technologies and pedagogies? How could we be better caretakers and caregivers in the context of post-secondary education and in service of student learning?

## Concept: Scaffolding
♥ A structure around the outside. Infinite points of entry. ♥

Not a series of discrete steps that assumes everyone starts and ends up at the same place.
Any discussion of pedagogy needs to include a critical examination of our tools, what they afford, who they exclude…

Most higher ed teaching practices are unexamined, because teachers are rarely given space to think…
1.	Start by trusting students
2.	Realize fairness is not an excuse for lack of empathy.

# The Sessions
---
**Diversity, Adversity, Perversity and the University: Opportunities for Embedding & Celebratin Diversity in Class Maters**
Presenters: [David Geary](https://twitter.com/gearsgeary) & [Ki Wight](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kiwight)

**Key Takeaway**: Do a diversity audit on images, videos and other class materials that you use your day-to-day in classroom. Images and videos used in classroom presentations can promote diversity (racial, sexual, gender, ability) without necessarily being the subject of the course.

**Recommended Reading** Audrey Watters [Ed-Tech's Inequalities](http://hackeducation.com/2015/04/08/inequalities)

## My AHA Moment

**Session:** Delivering a Better Experience by Using the Open, Collaborative and Flexible Grav CMS - Inside or Outside of your LMS

**Presenter:** [Paul Hibbitts](http://hibbittsdesign.org/)

Grav leverages forward-looking standards such as Markdown for platform-independent content and enables Git-based collaborative workflows, both which naturally also support the 5 Rs of Open Educational Resources.
---

![Grav CMS logo](https://getgrav-grav.netdna-ssl.com/user/pages/03.blog/new-logo/grav-logo.png?g-3f3de419)

My first forey into Open was through open source projects such as WordPress. Grav is a headless CMS that can be incorporated into your institutional LMS as well. Never be trapped into a proprietary ecosystem if you are capable.  Grav gives you the capabilities to achieve this.
---

# What is Grav?
* Modern flat file CMS
	* Files based also supports version control.
	* Good for smaller sites, simplicity, portability.
* Modular & Git Based Workflow

**Conclusion**  Grav is all the things!

## Session: Making Pressbooks Better
Presenter: [Zoe Wake Hyde](https://twitter.com/zwhnz)

Disclaimer - Whatcom Community Colleges uses Pressbooks to deliver our [Open Textbooks](http://librarywp.whatcom.edu/press) to our students.  This was a roadmap update.

♥ Open source to the rescue again ♥

When applying for the [professional development grant](https://www.sos.wa.gov/library/libraries/grants/professional-development.aspx) I chose these priorities.  Yes all of these.  I couldn't decide.

1. Expand services for learning and access to information:
2. Develop library services that provide all users:
3. Advance the delivery of library and information services:
4. Provide electronic and other linkages:
6. Target library services to diverse communities:
7. Target library and information services to the underserved:

---

## How did my participation in the 2018 Festival of Learning address the LSTA priorities I chose?
---

First Example
## Open Source Technologies
Our library continues to develop our skills in using platform neutral technologies that exemplify out committments to accessibility and diversity of learners. Using open source technologies in combination with open licensing standards demonstrates that we:
1. Have the technical capabilities to expand services for learning and access to information
2. Be able to target services to diverse communities including those with low-bandwidth

---

Second Example
## Universal Design for Learning

Our information literacy modules are being updated with UDL as one of our guiding principles. With UDL we will be able to better expand our teaching services for learning and access to information and better serve all users. We hope these practices become ingrained in our outreach efforts especially as they pertain to underserved and diverse communities.
---

Third Example
## Empathy and compassion should be infused into our teaching methods regardless of the technology or materials.

This relates to the main theme of the conference. We can never forget the humanity or the purpose of our vocation. Here is a small article as an example:

# "the outcomes"
How will this directly impact my end users.  
Explain the outcomes and their potential impact on service for my customers.

---

The above three outcomes have reinforced and rejuvenated my commitments to openness, compassion and using solid pedagogical theory to inform my choices regarding information services to our learning community.
---
![13th](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/13NumberThirteenInCircle.png)
Why are these outcomes important?
---

These outcomes are important because without compassion, without equity without loving human kindness we cannot learn.
