Thanks!

Nice, Roe! I didn't even know GitHub supported the creation of presentations. Cool! Just one really small thing, about the description of how fair use impacts the CC licenses. (See rubric comment.) If you'd like to add some more description to that slide and resubmit, go for it. Just add your presentation again to this assignment area and I'll get a ping letting me know you resubmitted.
