# What is copyrightable and what is not?
From the constitutional beginnings it was understood that certain things were not copyrightable. You can find a [comprehensive listing with explanations here](http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/what-is-public-domain.html).

One item on that list that deserves some further thought is the concept of the "idea-expression dichotomy".  Ideas are not copyrightable but a particular expression of an idea (such as a book, a song, a blog post) is subject to copyright protection.

## Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. § 102):

> In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. 

This dichotomy has been troublesome due the fact that reasonable people can have different notions of what constitutes an idea and what constitutes the expression of that idea. A quote from the courts illustrates this: 

>"Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc." from the Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1960).
