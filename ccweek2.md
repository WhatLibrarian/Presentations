# What is copyrightable and what is not?
From the constitutional beginnings it was understood that certain things were not copyrightable. You can find a [comprehensive listing with explanations here](http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/what-is-public-domain.html).

One item on that list that deserves some further thought is the concept of the "idea-expression dichotomy".  Ideas are not copyrightable but a particular expression of an idea (such as a book, a song, a blog post) is subject to copyright protection.

## Copyright Act of 1976 (17 U.S.C. § 102):

> In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. 

This dichotomy has been troublesome due the fact that reasonable people can have different notions of what constitutes an idea and what constitutes the expression of that idea. A quote from the courts illustrates this: 

>"Obviously, no principle can be stated as to when an imitator has gone beyond copying the 'idea,' and has borrowed its 'expression.' Decisions must therefore inevitably be ad hoc." from the Peter Pan Fabrics, Inc. v. Martin Weiner Corp., 274 F.2d 487 (2d Cir. 1960).

# How a person receives copyright protection for their work
Copyright in the United States is
## Automatic
Copyright is automatic at the point of creation.  No further action required (unless you need to protect your copyrights in court). 
## Systematic
Everything, all the things. The moment you have expressed your creation in a tangible format (photo, web, print, writing, etc) than your creation is protected by U.S. Copyright. It is only through a voluntary open license scheme (like creative commons) that you can loosen the automatic restrictions.

# The Public Domain
When works achieve escape velocity from the force of copyright - they are elevated to the Public Domain where no legal use restrictions remain.

A newsletter titled "[The Public Domain Review](https://publicdomainreview.org/)" can provide inspiration from the past to draw on.

This [tuturial on what is or is not in the public domain](http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/copyright-public-domain.html) can be a useful place to gain a comprehension around this.

# Fair Use
The most important part of Fair Use (FU) to remember is that FU is a right derived from Freedom of Speech and designed to protect those freedoms against the restrictions otherwise inherant in copyright laws.  The dark side of copyright can be seen in censorship and 'take-down' notices run amok as well as threatening litigation to supress the works of journalists and others.  FU is not an 'exemption' rather copright is an exemption of our 1st Amendment rights.  FU is also automatic and if you would like to explore how the judicial system has ruled so far, check out the [Fair Use Database](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html).  

A voluntary exemption to traditional copyright is voluntary licensing such as Creative Commons.
