# the three layers of the CC licenses

The utitily of the Creative Commons license is that it comes in three useful layers.
---

## A Human Readable layer
Features easy to read text and designed for clarity and comprehension.
---
## A Computer Readable layer
For interoperability between machines and software
---
And for those of us who are neither humans nor a robots ...
---
## A Lawyer Readable layer

# how the Creative Commons licenses affect exceptions and limitations to copyright
---
As a layer on top of national copyright laws.  Creative Commons helps creators and users leverage existing laws and help redefine sharing in a digital world.
---
# how the CC licenses affect works in the public domain
---

Because Creative Commons licenses often serve as wrap-around licenses there is a danger of reencapsulating the public domain accidently.  For instance if someone puts a creative commons copyright symbol on a public domain novel or a federal document. On the other hand, sometimes a CC0 mark or a public domain mark help clarify content use for downstream users.  For instance many U.S. Government websites lack any copyright notice it is sometimes confusing for users to understand what sort of use is permitted.
